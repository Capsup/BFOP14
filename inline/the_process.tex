The problem involves the following work domains:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{OMT and Valcon recruiters} contact and acquire particulars of the new employee. They send this to accounting. \\
(Source: appendix \quoteref{app:danni_initiation}{danni_init_recruiter}).

\item \emph{Accounting} sets the employee up in the economical systems and handles the contract. \\
(Source: appendix \quoteref{app:danni_initiation}{danni_init_accounting}).

\item \emph{IT} sets the employee up in the internal systems, sets up a computer and sends it to him/her, and sometimes sets up a phone and internet connection as well. \\
(Source: appendix \quoteref{app:danni_initiation}{danni_init_IT}).

\item \emph{New employees} are contacted about contract, computer, phone, and internet information. \\
