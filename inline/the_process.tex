Entering newly hired employees into the systems at Valcon and requisitioning the required hardware is currently a stressful process.

Initiators of the process in both Valcon and OMT send information to accounting, who proceeds to enter information into some systems while IT enters information into other systems, sets the hardware for the new employee up, and sends it to her.
The new employee is contacted both by the initiators and IT, and sometimes by accounting as well.

But the core of the problem is that the process sometimes has to be very quick.
In that case, the initiators initiate the process both in IT and accounting at the same time, leading to more stress and intercommunication between them.

Looking at the process it seems essential to take a deeper look at the following work areas in order to get a better understanding of the problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item HR (the initiators)
\item Accounting
\item IT
\end{itemize}
