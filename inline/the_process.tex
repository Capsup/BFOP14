The process of entering newly hired employees into the systems at Valcon and requisitioning the required hardware is currently a complicated matter.
The process starts in accounting when an employee has been hired.
A contract has to be formulated and the new employee has to be contacted in order to receive their particulars.

When this information has been collected it is entered into QHR and IT is contacted to let them know that a new employee has been hired.
IT then uses the information in QHR to create a new user in AD and give them a mailbox on the Exchange Server.
At the same time IT contacts the new employee about their preferences for phone and internet.

When they have received these from the employee they contact Valcon's communications provider in order to set the new employee up according to their preferences.
A PC is set up according to the new employee's needs, based on which department they will work for.
Finally information about the handed out gear is recorded in TechAdm.

Looking at the process it seems essential to take a deeper look at the following work areas in order to get a better understanding of the problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item HR
\item Accounting
\item IT
