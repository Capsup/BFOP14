Entering newly hired employees into the systems at Valcon involves the following work areas:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{OMT and Valcon recruiters} contact the new employee, and acquire particulars. They send this to accounting.
\item \emph{Accounting} sets the employee up in the economical systems and sends contract.
\item \emph{IT} sets the employee up in the internal systems, sets up a computer and sends it to him/her, and possibly sets up a phone and internet connection as well.
\item \emph{New employees} are contacted with contract, computer, phone and internet information. 
\end{itemize}

Since the process should in its entirety be transparent to new employees we have decided not to perform further analysis of this work area.
The remaining work areas are however subject to interview and analysis. \\

A visual representation of the organization as well as the work domains to research can be seen in appendix \ref{app:OrganizationalChart}.

This is based on information retrieved from interview \ref{app:danni_initiation}.
