The following chapter describes our understanding of Valcon as a company. This includes the environment in which they operate, an analysis of their business model, their business and IT strategies, and an identification of which work domains that affect the problem.

We conducted the analysis before realising that OMT was a big part of the problem, and therefore the analysis in regards to OMT is very limited.

\section{Business environment}
As we are working with internal support functions, we provide only summaries of our environment analyses here.
