However, we were able to glean some of it through the interviews and meetings.

The Valcon Group is in rapid growth and have a continued focus on keeping this growth as high as possible. (Sources: "Fra 120 til 350 på 5 år, eksplosiv vækst.", Danni: "Business Strategy = vækst". from appendix \ref{app:danni_initiation}).

Valcon's IT strategy focuses on streamlining IT activities, being cost efficient, outsourcing labor intensive tasks, making work easier for the consultants, few but strong partnerships and choosing off-the-shelf systems instead of customized systems.

Furthermore they maintain a flat hierachy, while trying not to impose structures on employees. (Source:" Firmastruktur: 1. Fire medarbejderværdier: Integritet, Glæde, Performance og Kompetence. 2. Meget flad hierakistruktur (appendix \ref{app:danni_initiation}))
