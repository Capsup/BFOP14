We were not able to acquire the business strategy, as it is not public and Valcon were not interested in sharing it. (Source: appendix \ref{app:danni_initiation}.)
However, we were able to glean some of it through the interviews and meetings
The Valcon Group is in rapid growth and have a continued focus on keeping this growth as high as possible.

\subsubsection{IT strategy}
Valcon's IT strategy focuses on streamlining IT activities, being cost efficient, outsourcing labor intensive tasks, making work easier for the consultants, few but strong partnerships and choosing off-the-shelf systems instead of customized systems.

See appendix \ref{app:it_strategy} for the original document.

\subsubsection{Company values}
Valcon is guided by four values internally: Integrity, joy, performance, and competence.
Valcon consulting also values consultants joy and time very highly, which means that they don't impose structures on them, and that the hierarchy is very flat.

These values are documented in our first meeting with Danni, appendix \ref{app:danni_initiation}.
