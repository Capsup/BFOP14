\subsubsection{Business strategy}
We were not able to acquire Valcon's business strategy, as it is not public and Valcon were not interested in sharing it. (Source: appendix \ref{app:business_strategy_refusal}). 
However, we were able to glean some of it through the interviews and meetings:

Valcon is in rapid growth and have a continued focus on keeping this growth as high as possible. 

(Sources: appendix \quoteref{app:danni_initiation}{danni_init_eksplosiv_vekst} and appendix \quoteref{app:danni_initiation}{danni_init_business_strategy_vekst}).

\subsubsection{IT strategy}
Valcon's IT strategy focuses on streamlining IT activities, being cost efficient, outsourcing labor intensive tasks, making work easier for the consultants, few but strong partnerships and choosing off-the-shelf systems instead of customized systems.

See appendix \ref{app:it_strategy} for the original document.

\subsubsection{Company values}
Valcon is guided by four values internally: Integrity, joy, performance, and competence.
Furthermore they value a flat hierarchy.
