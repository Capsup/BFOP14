OMT operates within an environment where they aren't facing a lot of competition. 
There aren't many ship designers building war ships and this places OMT in a position where they need employees with that specific experience and there aren't many candidates, as most of these employees are most likely already employed somewhere else.
Because of this, OMT finds a lot of their workforce within other ship design companies. 
Since these other companies work in other fields where OMT doesn't, they don't mind subcontracting the employees that OMT wants, as this just gives them more work.
