Valcon operates within an competitive environment where image is key. 
There's a major need for experienced and knowledgeable consultants but there's also alot of competition in the field.
Not because there's alot of competitors within the fields that Valcon works within, but rather because it's the same big firms that Valcon have to compete agaisnt every time. 
This means they all know each other and know exactly what kind of prices and quality the opposing firms can bring.
Due to this, Valcon's business strategy has been to hire the best and brightest employees and accept the fact that they're unable to be the cheapest organisation to hire. 
However, they pride themself with being a company who follows their customers all the way to the finish line with the projects that they've been hired to do.

They often refer to themself as the 'how' company, as they are often employed in projects where a competing consulation firm has been hired to write the initial report and figure out what to do, but Valcon are then employed to actually conclude the project by implementing the solution given to them.

This means that Valcon is a company competeting on quality and knowledge rather than on the price, meaning that Valcon is able to compete with other companies that might be fighting each other on the price.
