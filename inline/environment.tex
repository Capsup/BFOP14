Valcon operates within an competitive environment where image is key. 
There's a major need for experienced and knowledgeable consultants but there's also a lot of competition in the field.
Due to this, Valcon's business strategy has been to hire the best and brightest employees and accept the fact that they're unable to be the cheapest organisation to hire,
but they pride themselves with being a company who follows their customers all the way to the finish line with the projects that they've been hired to do. 
They work hard trying to hire consultants within a wide range of fields, meaning there's a high chance that they have just the consultant a new project needs, no matter what field the project operates within. 
This means that Valcon is a company competing on quality and knowledge rather than on the price, meaning that Valcon is able to compete with other companies that might be fighting each other on the price.
