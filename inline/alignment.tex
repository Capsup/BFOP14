This section aims to explain how the recruitment process problem we are dealing with is relevant to Valcon as a whole.\\\todo{Delete?}

\noindent Part of Valcon's business strategy is to maintain a high growth rate for the company.
A high growth rate means many new employees.

Group Support Functions has problems dealing with the current amount of employments.

Since Valcon intends to keep growing and Group Support Functions have problems keeping up, there is a need to optimize the process.
