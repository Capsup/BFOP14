In order to fully understand and analyse the problem we have interviewed the following employees of Valcon:
Lisbeth (of Accounting), Peter (of IT) and Hanne (no business area).
After these interviews we realized that the problem mostly originated in OMT, so we interviewed Jytte (BA Manager at OMT) as well.
Additionally we have conducted some minor observations of the work processes in the Accounting and IT departments.

Through the interviews we realized that Jytte and Hanne were not the recruiters of OMT and Valcon respectively.
Even though we wanted to interview the actual recruiters, we did not get permission to initiate contact. (\quoteref{app:emails}{line:danni_says_no_to_recruiter_interview})

We wanted to supplement this with a questionnaire analysis of how the consultants had experienced the recruitment process, but we were unable to get permission to do so.
