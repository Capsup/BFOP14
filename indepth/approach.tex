In order to fully understand and analyse the problem we have interviewed the following employees at Valcon:
Lisbeth (of Accounting), Peter (of IT) and Hanne (no business area, HR function).
After these interviews we realized that the problem mostly originated in OMT, so we interviewed Jytte (BA Manager at OMT) as well.
Additionally we have conducted three observations of the Accounting and IT departments.

Through the interviews we realized that Jytte and Hanne were not the actual recruiters of OMT and Valcon.
It was deemed that interviewing the actual recruiters would take up too much valuable time from them.
(See appendix \quoteref{app:emails}{line:danni_says_no_to_recruiter_interview}.)

We would have liked to supplement with a questionnaire given to all employees at the Valcon Group.
The purpose of the questionnaire would be to get an understanding of the employees' perspectives on the process of new employee registration.
However, it was deemed that such a questionnaire would take up too much valuable time from the employees.
