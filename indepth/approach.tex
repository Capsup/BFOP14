Based on the process analysis in which we identified the work areas relevant to the process, we conducted various interviews.
We chose to begin with interviewing Lisbeth (of accounting) and Peter (of IT), as they are the ones most affected by the process.
We chose to interview Hanne (NBA) as well, as she is the initiator of the process at Valcon.
Finally, we chose to observe both IT and accounting, to get a sense of the work flow there.

When we analyzed the data, we realized that we had to interview Jytte (process initiator at OMT) as well, as much of the problem originates in OMT.

Through the interviews we realised that Jytte and Hanne were not the recruiters of OMT and Valcon respectively, however we did not have permission to initiate contact with the actual recruiters.

Even though this information had been valid for the assessment in its entirety, we believe that the information retrieved from Hanne and Jytte in regard to recruitment was sufficient.

Based on Valcons key values we were asked not to conduct a quantitative questionaire analysis of how the consultants experienced the process (source appendix \ref{app:danni_initiation}). The process should however be transparent to them, and thus we deemed that the analysis would not have a greater impact on the overall solutions procured.
