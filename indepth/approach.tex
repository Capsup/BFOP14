In order to fully understand and analyse the problem we have interviewed the following employees of Valcon:
Lisbeth (of Accounting), Peter (of IT) and Hanne (no business area).
After these interviews we realized that the problem mostly originated in OMT, so we interviewed Jytte (BA Manager at OMT) as well.
Additionally we have conducted three observations of the Accounting and IT departments.

Through the interviews we realized that Jytte and Hanne were not the actual recruiters of OMT and Valcon.
We did not get permission to interview the actual recruiters.
(See appendix \quoteref{app:emails}{line:danni_says_no_to_recruiter_interview}.)

We wanted to conduct a questionnaire analysis of how the consultants had experienced the recruitment process, but we did not get permission to do so.
