Based on the process analysis in which we identified the work areas relevant to the process, we conducted various interviews.
We chose to begin with interviewing Lisbeth (of accounting) and Peter (of IT), as they are the ones most affected by the process.
We chose to interview Hanne (NBA) as well, as she is the initiator of the process at Valcon.
Finally, we chose to observe both IT and accounting, to get a sense of the work flow there.

When we analyzed the data, we realized that we had to interview Jytte (process initiator at OMT) as well, as much of the problem originates in OMT.

Based on Valcons key values we were asked not to conduct a quantitative questionaire analysis of how the consultants experience the process (source appendix \ref{app:danni_initiation}). The process should however be transparent to them, and thus we deemed that the analysis would not have a greater impact on the overall data gathered.
