Based on the process analysis in which we identified the work areas relevant to the process, we conducted various interviews.
We chose to begin with interviewing Lisbeth (of accounting) and Peter (of IT), as they are the ones most affected by the process.
We chose to interview Hanne (NBA) as well, as she is the initiator of the process at Valcon.
Finally, we chose to observe both IT and accounting, to get a sense of the work flow there.

When we analyzed the data, we realized that we had to interview Jytte (process initiator at OMT) as well, as much of the problem originates in OMT.

Through the interviews we realised that Jytte and Hanne were not the recruiters of OMT and Valcon respectively. Even though we wanted to interview the actual recruiters, we did not get permission to initiate contact.

We wanted to conduct a quantitative questionaire analysis of how the consultants had experienced the recruitment process, but we were unable to get permission to do so.
The process should however be transparent to them, so we believe our solutions still have value.
