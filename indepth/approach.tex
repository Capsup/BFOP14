In order to fully understand and analyse the problem we have interviewed the following employees at Valcon:
Lisbeth (of Accounting), Peter (of IT), Hanne (no business area, HR function) and Jytte from OMT (BA Manager).
Additionally we have conducted three observations of the Accounting and IT departments.

Through the interviews we realized that Jytte and Hanne were not the actual recruiters of OMT and Valcon.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to interview the actual recruiters.
(See appendix \quoteref{app:emails}{line:danni_says_no_to_recruiter_interview}.)

We would have liked to supplement with a questionnaire given to all employees at the Valcon Group.
The purpose of the questionnaire would be to get an understanding of the employees' perspectives on the process of new employee registration.
However, we were not given permission to do so.
