We chose to begin with interviewing Lisbeth (of accounting) and Peter (of IT), as they are the ones most affected by the process.
We chose to interview Hanne (NBA) as well, as she is the initiator of the process at Valcon.
Finally, we chose to observe both IT and accounting, to get a sense of the work flow there.

When we analyzed the data, we realized that we had to interview Jytte (process initiator at OMT) as well, as much of the problem originates in OMT.
