We have identified the following stakeholders:
\begin{itemize}
\item Head of IT - Initiator of the project. high power, high interest.
\item IT department - Main recipients of the project. Low power, high interest.
\item Accounting - Recipient of the project. Some power, high interest.
\item HR in Valcon and OMT - Part of the process. Some power, some interest.
\item Recruiters in Valcon and OMT - We may change their work flow. Some power, low interest.
\item Group Operations Director - Head of Accounting, IT and HR. Very high power, low interest.
\end{itemize}
We chose to interview the head of IT, the IT department, Accounting and HR in both Valcon and OMT. 
We would have liked to interview the recruiters in OMT and Valcon, but were unable to do so.
The Group Operations Director has a lot of power, but only low interest, and is a beneficiary, so we chose not to interview him.
