We have identified the following stakeholders: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Head of IT - Initiator of the project. high power, high interest.
\item IT department - Main recipients of the project. Low power, high interest.
\item Accounting - Recipient of the project. Some power, high interest.
\item HR in Valcon and OMT - Part of the process. Some power, some interest.
\item Recruiters in Valcon and OMT - We may change their work flow. Some power, low interest.
\item Group Operations Director - Head of Accounting, IT and HR. Very high power, low interest.
\end{itemize}
The Group Operations Director has a lot of power, but only low interest, and is a beneficiary, so we chose not to interview him.
