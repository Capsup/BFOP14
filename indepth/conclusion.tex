Optimizing the recruitment process at Valcon is not a simple matter of changing the current process to a more standardized form.
The needs are quite different between OMT and Valcon and the optimized solution needs to take this into account.

Additionally it is not just a matter of introducing a new system to automate the process more than it is today. It is also a matter of making an organisational change, making sure that the recruiters who initiate the process know exactly what information is required for the rest of the process, such that the correct information can be acquired from the beginning and passed on.
