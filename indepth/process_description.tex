The process starts when a new employee has been hired.
An initiator (often Hanne or Jytte, sometimes other people) contacts accounting with information on the new employee.
A contract has to be formulated and, if there is information missing, the new employee has to be contacted in order to complete their particulars.

The information is entered into QHR and IT is contacted to let them know that a new employee has been hired.
IT then uses the information in QHR to create a new user in AD and give them a mailbox on the Exchange Server, and contacts accounting again with the employee's initials.
Accounting, after receiving the initials, enters the employee's particulars in Maconomy and Bluegarden (or in the case of foreign departments, the relevant salary system for that country).

At the same time IT contacts the new employee about their preferences for phone and internet.
When they have received these from the employee they contact Valcon's communications provider in order to set the new employee up according to their preferences.

Also at the same time, a PC is set up by IT according to the new employee's needs, based on which department they will work for.
Finally information about the handed out gear is recorded in TechAdm.
