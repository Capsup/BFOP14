To implement the ideas explained in this section, we suggest that Valcon takes a 'plunge' approach to the implementation, meaning the entire vision of the overall change is implemented all at once.
We see no reason to incrementally introduce the solutions to the company, since none of them are mutually exclusive. 
They can easily be introduced at the same time since none of the solutions carry much risk.
This also reduces the amount of time necessary for the employees to get accustomed to the new processes.\todo{But increases the risk that only some of the new processes get followed.}

\subsubsection{Follow-up}
For follow-up, we would like to conduct interviews with each of the most affected parties 3 months after implementation.
This would include the IT department, Accounting and HR of Valcon and OMT.
After this, we could recommend further changes or corrections to the solutions. \todo{Har vi tænkt os at gøre det her? Hvis ikke, skal vi så foreslå det?}
