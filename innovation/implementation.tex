To implement the solutions explained in this chapter, we suggest that Valcon takes a 'plunge' approach.
This means that all the solutions are implemented at the same time.
We see no reason to incrementally introduce the solutions, since none of them are mutually exclusive and none them carry much risk.
It also reduces the amount of time necessary for the employees to grow accustomed to the new processes.
It does, however, increase the risk that only some of the new processes are used.

\subsubsection{Follow-up}
We would recommend conducting interviews with each of the most affected parties 3 months after implementation.
This would include the IT, Accounting, and Recruitment departments at Valcon and OMT.
After this, it would be possible to recommend further changes or corrections to the solutions.
