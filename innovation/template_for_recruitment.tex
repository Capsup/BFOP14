Create a template for recruitment, that also acts as a checklist, so recruiters know what information is required.

\subsubsection{Pros} Could reduce the amount of missing information in the initial email to Accounting or IT. 
Also leads to a better defined process.

\subsubsection{Cons} Requires additional work by recruiter.
Must be maintained.

\subsubsection{Finance}
This solution would save appr. 6.500 DKK in the first year and appr. 8.000 anually afterwards, including initial costs and maintenance.

\subsubsection{Risks}
Should the template get out of date, irrelevant information would have to be sorted through every time. 
If the template is too information heavy, some may ignore it.
Valcon employees generally dislike forms and rigid processes, so they may ignore it.

\subsubsection{Handling the risks}
It's important to revise the template every once in a while.
If the recruiters don't use the template, they should be reminded that it makes the recruitment process smoother and faster.
It should only be implemented in OMT, as Valcon employees probably would dislike it.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
Creating a template for recruitment solves the problem of not always getting the required information. 
Creating one for OMT recruitment seems a good idea.
Creating one for Valcon would be a bad idea, as it would take time from management and consultants, but creating one for Hanne might work, as she would be reminded of the information required.
