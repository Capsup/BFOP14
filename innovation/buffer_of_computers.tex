\emph{Description:} Keep 6 pre-installed computers ready for use at OMT and at Valcon, for emergencies or very quick recruitments.

\emph{Pros:} Would reduce response times to urgent recruitments.
Also useful if an employee's computer breaks, to reduce downtime.

\emph{Cons:} Needs a little more managing from IT, as
computers will need to be kept updated and ready.
As all computers are not in use, this creates a small overhead.

\subsubsection{Finance} 
This solution has a big initial investment (240.000 DKK) and will not break even unless errors happen.
The money saved comes from employees being able to get back to work quickly after a computer breaks down, or letting new employees start work faster.

\subsubsection{Risks}
Maintaining a buffer of computers could result in the computers getting outdated in case the buffer is too big compared to the amount of new hires.

\subsubsection{Handling risks}
Reducing the amount of computers kept in the buffer will reduce the risk of them getting outdated

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
Whether this solution should be implemented depends on how many errors happen.
We have not been able to get an estimate of how much time is lost due to computer errors or new employees waiting for computers.
As it would increase work enjoyment in IT and help with errors, we would recommend implementing this even with a small financial loss.
