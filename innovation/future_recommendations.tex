The following are two recommendations for future projects that might discover more to improve upon in the recruitment process.

\subsubsection{Analyze OMT process}
Conduct an analysis of whether the OMT recruitment process can be improved.
The analysis should focus on whether they can know further in advance who and when someone is needed, so the number of urgent cases can be reduced.

\subsubsection{Further automation of PC installation process}
The installation process is very time consuming, and is a candidate for automation.
Looking into whether more of it could be automated could save time.
