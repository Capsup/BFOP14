The following is two recommendations for future projects that may discover more things to improve in the recruitment process.

\subsection{Analyze OMT process}
Conduct an analysis of whether the OMT recruitment process can be improved.
Investigate whether they can know further in advance who and when someone is needed, so the number of urgent cases can be reduced.

\subsection{Further automation of PC installation process}
The installation process is very time consuming, and is a candidate for automation.
Looking into whether more of it could be automated could save time.
