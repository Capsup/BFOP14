In this section we will describe the most relevant solution propositions and, on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis, document the impact on the company as a whole.

\section{Solutions}
\todo{Description, pros/cons, cost/benefit for hver}
Please refer to appendix \ref{app:solution_propositions} (p. \pageref{app:solution_propositions}) for a complete list of solution propositions. Each solutions is listed with a verdict of its suitability, sorting out the most improbable.
The most relevant solutions are subject to cost/benefit analysis in the following sections.

\subsection{Template for recruitment}
\emph{Description:} Create a template for recruitment so recruiters know what information is required. A template also functions as a checklist, ensuring that the writer knows what information to send.

\emph{Pros:} Could reduce the amount of missing information in the initial email to accounting or IT. 
Also leads to a better defined process.

\emph{Cons:} Requires additional work by recruiter. 
If template is too information heavy, some may ignore it.
Valcon employees dislike forms and rigid processes, so they may ignore it.

\subsubsection{Finance}

\subsubsection{Conclusion} Creating a template for OMT recruitment seems a good idea.
Creating one for Valcon would be a bad idea, as it would take time from management and consultants, but creating one for Hanne might work, as she would be reminded of the information required.

\subsection{Change of attitude toward IT}
\emph{Description:} Change the company attitude toward IT, from the current "they are there to fix my problems" to "they are there if I really need them".
We do not know how to implement this, but as Valcon is a consulting company, we assume they have a strategy for this case.

\emph{Pros:} May reduce the number of edge cases, recruiters would be more likely to send recruitment information in early or give warning that a quick recruitment is coming up.
Doesn't require extra time from recruiters.

\emph{Cons:} It would be hard to measure the success of the change - when is an attitude changed? - but measuring the result of the change could be done.

\subsubsection{Finance} For benefit, measure current number of edge cases and their average time cost.
Make a guess as to how many of these would be avoided with the change (15\%?).
Compute hours gained and multiply with wages for IT.
As for cost, 8-10 hours of work for a consultant might be enough to implement this.

\subsubsection{Conclusion} 

\subsection{Buffer of computers}
\emph{Description:} Keep 2-3 pre-installed computers ready for use at OMT and at Valcon, for emergencies or very quick recruitments.

\emph{Pros:} Would reduce response times to urgent recruitments.
Also useful if an employee's computer breaks, to reduce downtime.

\emph{Cons:} Needs a little more managing from IT, as
computers will need to be kept updated and ready.
As all computers are not in use, this creates a small overhead.

\subsubsection{Finance} Free. Benefit in time gained. Resources lying dormant.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

\subsection{New HR system}
\emph{Description:} Acquire a new HR system to facilitate communication between accounting, IT, and recruiters.
Valcon is already looking at HR systems.

\emph{Pros:} Recruitment process becomes more standardized, as it always follows the same path.
Information becomes more consistent, as personal spreadsheets are less needed. 
This also safeguards against employees leaving.
Errors are less likely, as number of manual entries of information is reduced.

\emph{Cons:} Costly to implement, requires training of accounting, IT, and recruiter employees.
Also requires maintenance.

\subsubsection{Finance} +: Try to put a price on errors, count how many of them occur, guess how many will be eliminated, sum their costs.
Price of current HR system (Lotus Notes).

-: Price of new HR system.
Price of data transfer.
Price of training.
Price of maintenance.

\subsubsection{Conclusion} This solution is very necessary, as it is the only way information becomes more consistent.

\section{Other recommendations}
Need rewriting \todo{Is this section good? Is it relevant?}

\subsection{Analyze OMT process}
Conduct an analysis of whether the OMT process can be improved so they know further in advance who and when someone is needed, so the number of urgent cases can be reduced.

\subsection{Further automation of install process}
The install process is very time consuming, and is a candidate for automation.
Looking into whether more of it could be automated could save time.
