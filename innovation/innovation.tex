In this section we will explain our overall vision, describe and analyze our solutions, recommend an implementation strategy and finally make some recommendations for future analysis.

\section{Solutions}
The following is a prioritized list of the solutions that we found most suitable to solve the problem.
For the complete list of solutions, please refer to appendix \ref{app:solution_propositions}.

Each solution contains a description, its positive and negative effects, a financial estimate, a risk assessment and how to handle it, and a conclusion describing its suitability.

The solutions have only marginal cost or financial benefit, so we have chosen to only summarize our financial analysis in the solutions.
The complete cost/benefit analysis is in appendix \ref{app:cost_benefit_analysis}.
