In this section we will explain our overall vision, describe and analyze our solutions, recommend an implementation strategy and finally make some recommendations for future analysis.

\section{Vision for overall change}
IT and Accounting are frustrated by the recruitment process and feel that time is wasted on it.
Our solutions aim to alleviate these frustrations and reduce the time spent on the process.

Instead of a single solution to the problem, we have decided to look at many small solutions, and recommend implementing many of them.
This is because the Valcon Group is two companies, and solutions that fit OMT do not necessarily fit Valcon Consulting.
We don't want to throw the current process away, but instead want to improve it in small ways to be able to scale with the company growth and possibly save some money.
Finally, we weigh work enjoyment and appreciation highly, as these are important for employee joy, integrity and competence, three of the Valcon Group's key values.

\section{Solutions}
Please refer to appendix \ref{app:solution_propositions} (p. \pageref{app:solution_propositions}) for a complete list of solution propositions.
Each solution contains a description, some positive and negative effects, a financial estimate (refer to appendix \ref{app:cost_benefit_analysis} for the cost/benefit analysis) and a conclusion describing it's suitability.

\subsection{Template for recruitment}
\emph{Description:} Create a template for recruitment so recruiters know what information is required. A template also functions as a checklist, ensuring that the writer knows what information to send.

\emph{Pros:} Could reduce the amount of missing information in the initial email to accounting or IT. 
Also leads to a better defined process.

\emph{Cons:} Requires additional work by recruiter. 
If template is too information heavy, some may ignore it.
Valcon employees dislike forms and rigid processes, so they may ignore it.

\subsubsection{Finance}
This solution would save appr. 6.500 DKK in the first year and appr. 8.000 anually afterwards, including initial costs and maintenance.

\subsubsection{Conclusion} Creating a template for OMT recruitment seems a good idea.
Creating one for Valcon would be a bad idea, as it would take time from management and consultants, but creating one for Hanne might work, as she would be reminded of the information required.

\subsection{Change of attitude toward IT}
\emph{Description:} Change the company attitude toward IT, from the current "they are there to fix my problems" to "they are there if I really need them".
Could be implemented with a small, internal campaign to improve relations to IT, and to make IT feel more appreciated.

\emph{Pros:} May reduce the number of edge cases, as recruiters would be more likely to send recruitment information in early or give warning that a quick recruitment is coming up.
Doesn't require extra time from recruiters.

\emph{Cons:} It would be hard to measure the success of the change - when is an attitude changed?
There might not be a financial gain.

\subsubsection{Finance} 
This solution would probably not save money, but the non-financial benefits are important and the cost is low (appr. 20.000 DKK once.)
Some money may be saved by reducing the amount of edge cases.

\subsubsection{Conclusion} 
We would recommend implementing this change. 
The reduced level of frustration in IT and greater work enjoyment would be worth it.

\subsection{Buffer of computers}
\emph{Description:} Keep 2-3 pre-installed computers ready for use at OMT and at Valcon, for emergencies or very quick recruitments.

\emph{Pros:} Would reduce response times to urgent recruitments.
Also useful if an employee's computer breaks, to reduce downtime.

\emph{Cons:} Needs a little more managing from IT, as
computers will need to be kept updated and ready.
As all computers are not in use, this creates a small overhead.

\subsubsection{Finance} 
This solution has a big initial investment (240.000 DKK) and will not break even unless errors happen.
The money saved comes from employees being able to get back to work quickly after a computer breaks down, or letting new employees start work faster.

\subsubsection{Conclusion}
Whether this solution should be implemented depends on how many errors happen.
We have not been able to get an estimate of how much time is lost due to computer errors or new employees waiting for computers.
As it would increase work enjoyment in IT and help with errors, we would recommend implementing this even with a small financial loss.

\subsection{New HR system}
\emph{Description:} Acquire a new HR system to facilitate communication between accounting, IT, and recruiters.
Valcon is already looking at HR systems.

\emph{Pros:} Recruitment process becomes more standardized, as it always follows the same path.
Information becomes more consistent, as personal spreadsheets are less needed. 
This also safeguards against employees leaving.
Errors are less likely, as number of manual entries of information is reduced.

\emph{Cons:} Costly to implement, requires training of accounting, IT, and recruiter employees.
Also requires maintenance.

\subsubsection{Finance}
We have been unable to make an estimate of the price of a new HR system.
\todo{Maybe we can make this estimate?}

\subsubsection{Conclusion} 
This solution is very necessary, as it is the only way information becomes more consistent.

\todo{do}

\section{Other recommendations}
Need rewriting \todo{Is this section good? Is it relevant?}

\subsection{Analyze OMT process}
Conduct an analysis of whether the OMT process can be improved so they know further in advance who and when someone is needed, so the number of urgent cases can be reduced.

\subsection{Further automation of install process}
The install process is very time consuming, and is a candidate for automation.
Looking into whether more of it could be automated could save time.
