IT and Accounting are frustrated by the recruitment process and feel that time is wasted on it.
Our solutions aim to alleviate these frustrations and reduce the time spent on the process.

Instead of a single solution to the problem, we have decided to look at many small solutions, and recommend implementing many of them.
This is because the Valcon Group is two companies, and solutions that fit OMT do not necessarily fit Valcon Consulting.
We don't want to throw the current process away, but instead want to improve it in small ways to be able to scale with the company growth and possibly save some money.
Finally, we weigh work enjoyment and appreciation highly, as these are important for employee joy, one of the Valcon Group's key values.
