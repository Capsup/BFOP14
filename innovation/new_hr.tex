Acquire a new off-the-shelf HR system to facilitate communication between accounting, IT, and recruiters.
Valcon is already looking at HR systems.

\subsubsection{Pros} Recruitment process may become more standardized.
Information becomes more consistent, as personal spreadsheets are less needed. 
This also safeguards against key employees leaving.
Errors are less likely, as number of manual entries of information are reduced.
It opens up the possibility of automating several key processes, reducing workload and wasted time further.

\subsubsection{Cons} Costly to implement, requires training of Accounting, IT, and Recruitment.
Also requires maintenance.

\subsubsection{Finance}
We have been unable to make an estimate of the price of a new HR system.

\subsubsection{Risks}
If the new HR system isn't compatible with current systems and processes, or can't completely replace old systems such as QHR, it could complicate the process even further, or not be used at all.

\subsubsection{Handling risks}
It is important to analyse the requirements for the new HR system, to ensure that it is compatible with the current systems and the entire process. 
Introducing the new system incrementally could also reduce associated risks, as it would be possible to receive feedback early and change the system accordingly. 
To reduce the risk of the system failing or not being used at all, training employees to use the new system is necessary.

\subsubsection{Conclusion} 
This solution is very necessary, as it is the only way to make information more consistent.
It also gives Accounting a greater overview of recruitments, and reduces the need for communication between Accounting, Recruitment, and IT.
