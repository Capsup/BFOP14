Currently, IT is generally regarded as a department that just solves whatever problem one might have. Some employees in the IT department do not agree. Adjusting the expectations between the IT department and Valcon could have benefits.

\subsubsection{Pros} 
If people are more aware of how the IT department functions, they are more likely to be considerate. If the IT department are more aware of how Valcon functions, they will better understand why their work is critical. This would improve job satisfaction.

\subsubsection{Cons}
Difficult to implement and measure. 

\subsubsection{Finance} 
This solution would probably not save money, but the non-financial benefits are important and the cost is low (appr. 20.000 DKK once.)
Some money may be saved by reducing the amount of edge cases.

\subsubsection{Risks}
It might not be possible to actually change the attitude that employees have towards IT already. Not only that, but putting focus on that incorrectly, could make the attitude towards IT even worse.

\subsubsection{Handling risks}
Should the risks mentioned above be realised for this solution, a way to handle it would be to launch another campaign, effectively trying again. 

\subsubsection{Conclusion} 
We would recommend implementing this change. 
The reduced level of frustration in IT and greater work enjoyment would be worth it.
