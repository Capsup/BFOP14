The following is a list of minor changes that would improve the process.
They have very little financial impact.
\begin{itemize}
\item Put a phone and internet form in the contract letter, asking for the information the IT department needs.

\emph{Pros and cons:} Would reduce the need for contact between the IT department and the new employee.
Would require a little maintenance.

\item Create two "Unknown Department" organisational units in the AD, one for Valcon and one for OMT, with relevant access rights. The IT department can then put employees whose department is unknown into these, and have a common place to look and update.

\emph{Pros and cons:} Would create a work flow for a non-standard process and thereby reduce errors. Would require some maintenance.

\item Define a process for OMT recruiters to alert IT when they know they will need new hires/subcontractors, so that IT can prepare before all data is gathered.

\emph{Pros and cons:} IT can use the information to plan ahead. Will reduce frustration in the IT department. Requires a little time and some planning from OMT recruiters.
\end{itemize}
