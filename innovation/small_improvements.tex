The following is a list of minor changes that would improve the process.
They have very little financial impact.
\begin{itemize}
\item Put a phone and internet form in contract letter, asking for the information the IT department needs.

\emph{Pros and cons:} Would reduce the need for contact between the IT department and the new employee.
Would require a little maintenance.

\item Create two "Unknown Department" organisational units in AD, one for Valcon and one for OMT with relevant access rights. The IT department can then put employees whose department is unknown into these, and have a common place to look and update.

\emph{Pros and cons:} Would create a work flow for non-standard process and thereby reduce errors. Would require some maintenance.

\item Define a process for OMT recruiters to alert IT when they are looking for new hires/subcontractors, so that IT can prepare before all data is gathered.

\emph{Pros and cons:} IT can use the information to plan ahead, setting a computer aside when they believe the information will be there. Will reduce frustration in the IT department. Requires a little time and some planning from OMT recruiters.
\end{itemize}
