\label{app:valcon_environment}
Valcon operates within an competitive environment where image and contacts are key. 
There's a great need for experienced and knowledgeable consultants but there's also a lot of competition in the field.
Not because there are a lot of competitors within the fields that Valcon works in, but rather because the competitors are the same every time.
This means they know each other and know exactly what kind of prices and quality the opposing firms will bring.
Due to this, Valcon's business strategy has been to hire the best and brightest employees and accept the fact that they're unable to be the cheapest organisation to hire.

They sell themselves mainly on knowledge and quality, rather than on price and pride themselves on being a company capable of the entire consultation process, from analysis to implementation.

They refer to themselves as the 'how' company, as they are often employed in projects where a competing consultation firm has been hired to write the analysis report and figure out 'what' to do. 
Valcon are then employed to conclude the project by implementing the solution.

Valcon's biggest threat is losing their consultants.
Consultants are drawn towards new and exciting opportunities, while working for the same company for a long time gets increasingly stale.
This means that sooner or later a consultant will grow tired of the current challenges he's facing and move on to another company.
