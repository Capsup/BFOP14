How can Valcon improve the new employee registration process, specifically, how can they reduce the number of cases not following the standardized process, or refit the standardized process to accommodate the open structure of the company?

The following three requirements need to be fulfilled for the project to be considered a success:
\begin{itemize}
\item
To maintain a standardized convention, communication should go through accounting every time, or standard process should be changed to allow for multiple paths.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Measure amount of tasks currently not following standard process (mean/month)
\item
After implementation, measure amount of tasks not following standard process (mean/month)
\item
If the number after implementation is 50\% lower, this requirement is fulfilled.
\end{itemize}
\item
Tasks that could be automated, should be.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Look at process, find all tasks that could be automated and the ones that already are, make a list stating whether a task is manual or automated, and whether it must be manual or could be automated.
\item
After implementation, look at list and compare number of “could be automated” tasks to current process.
\item
If 50\% of the tasks that were previously not automated, are now automated, this requirement is fulfilled.
\end{itemize}
\item
The current speed of the process must be maintained or improved.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Measure the current mean time from first mail to accounting or IT, to employee is registered and IT tasks are done before and after.
\item
If this time is the same or (preferably) faster, this requirement is fulfilled.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}





Define “task that could be automated”.
