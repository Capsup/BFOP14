\label{app:OMT_environment}
OMT operates within an environment where they aren't facing a lot of competition. 
There aren't many firms designing war ships, and this places OMT in a favorable position.

There aren't many ship designers with experience on war ships, so when OMT needs employees there aren't many candidates, and most of them are already employed elsewhere.
Because of this, OMT hires a lot of their workforce within other ship design companies.
Since these companies work in other fields than OMT, they don't mind OMT subcontracting their employees, as it benefits them as well.
