The business canvas gives an overview of Valcon as a business - what services they provide, what their key resources are and so on.
We constructed the canvas primarily from information from the Valcon website, along with information from initial interviews with the IT Manager of the company.
The canvas was later presented to the IT Manager, and then refined slightly from his feedback.
