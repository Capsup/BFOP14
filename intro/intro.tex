\section{Notes}
During the analysis we realized that OMT was an integral part of the problem, and started to analyze them as well. Our scope got too big, so we limited the amount of gathered knowledge from OMT to a single interview with a recruiter at OMT with a key person in regards to the process. 

We realize that this limits our general understanding of the procress, and thus most of the solutions proposed in regards to OMT are conducted based on limited knowledge, and should be further revised before implemented.
