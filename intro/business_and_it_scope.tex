During the initial phase we agreed to primarily analyse the problem in relation to the Valcon IT department. We agreed that it was logical to conduct our analysis in Valcon, and not OMT, as the IT department is stationed in Valcon and we had an idea that most of the problem originated there.

During the in-depth analysis, we realised that OMT hires were an integral part of the problem. We managed to interview a recruiter from OMT, but we decided that to try and conduct a full-scale in-depth analysis of OMT would be too ambitious, and break our original scope. 
We realise that this limits our general understanding of the process in OMT, and that solutions we propose in regards to OMT are made based on limited knowledge.
