Our original scope included the IT and Accounting departments of the Valcon Group, and the HR and Recruitment personnel at Valcon.

During the in-depth analysis, we realised that OMT recruitments were a big part of the problem.
This made us increase our scope to also include the HR and Recruitment personnel at OMT.

We would have liked to also observe the work processes of the HR and Recruitment departments and interview some new employees, but we chose to put these out of scope for this project, as we believe little new knowledge would be gained from these analyses.
