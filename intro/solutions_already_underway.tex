Valcon was aware that there was an issue in recruitment even before the project began.
A couple of years ago, the company changed its mail- and calendar platform from Lotus Notes to a Microsoft Exchange based solution. This meant that the old HR-system, a database in Notes, quickly became deprecated, as the information was only used during the hiring process, and not kept updated as before. This also meant that a lot of functionality that the fully integrated Notes system had, was lost.
There is a general knowledge that the situation is unstable, and that a lot of information is copy-pasted by hand, and a lot of data is not kept up to date in the way Valcon wants it to be.

Valcon is currently investigating possible new HR-systems to remedy this.

We have, during the course of this project, been aware that a solution to part of the problem was already underway, and we have had it in mind as we proposed our own solutions.
