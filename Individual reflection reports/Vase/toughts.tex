\section{External analysis with a local problem}
We spent some time analysing external factors affecting Valcon.
As our problem was local to the internal support functions, the external factors were of little consequence.
We learned only a few pieces of information from these analyses.
Next time, I will focus a little less on the external factors, to be able to study the internal relationships more extensively.

\section{The problem with minor IT design projects}
The problem we were faced with at Valcon was very small, somewhat rare, and in fact had little to do with IT.
That makes for a quite uninteresting project, and also reduces the usefulness of the tools and techniques of the MUST method.
While ethnographic analysis is still possible, it seems silly to engage in extreme analysis with such a small problem, and we can't get the time from management because we're not important enough.

All the literature of this course focuses on how to make the most of an IT project when you have it, or on knowing when to quit if a project is unrealistic.
Nowhere have we seen anything on what makes a problem good for an IT design project, or how to tackle minor projects with little interest from management.

I do not know whether having something on this would improve anything, but it was a frustration for us.
